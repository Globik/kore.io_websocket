Just like the node.js event emitter in C, based on [https://github.com/thlorenz/ee.c](https://github.com/thlorenz/ee.c)

Although I wanna add the second opaque pointer to the ee_on, ee_once family functions.

It'd better for the "this" keyword purpose in a typical C code workflow.

So far so good.

Got it.
